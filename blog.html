      <div class="accordion-body"><strong>localStorage:</strong> persists the storage across browser sessions. So
        even if the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved.
        There is no expiration. <br><br> <strong>sessionStorage:</strong> is cleared when the page session ends. A
        page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new
        window, this creates a new session and new storage.</div>

    <div class="accordion-body"><strong>Global Scope:</strong> The variables defined outside of any function or
      curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables
      can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
      <br><br>
      <strong> Block Scope:</strong>
      Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables
      inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
      something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

    <div class="accordion-body">JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. This means that JavaScript
      can do only one thing at a single point in time.

      The JavaScript engine executes a script from the top of the file and works its way down. It creates the
      execution contexts, pushes, and pops functions onto and off the call stack in the execution phase.

      If a function takes a long time to execute, you cannot interact with the web browser during the functionâ€™s
      execution because the page hangs.

      A function that takes a long time to complete is called a blocking function. Technically, a blocking
      function blocks all the interactions on the webpage, such as mouse click.

      An example of a blocking function is a function that calls an API from a remote server.</div>

      undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value
      of undefined is the primitive value undefined.
      <br>
      In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is not
      the case, avoid overriding it.)
      <br>
      A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns
      undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
      undefined if a value was not returned.</div>
